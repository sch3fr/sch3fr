### 'ello ðŸ«¡
I'm sch3fr. CS student, test engineer, overall computer nerd. I just like to mess around with anything that have chips and some kind of software.
My goal is just to make cool stuff.
This place is mostly to hold my incoherent projects at one place, but I hope you find some of it interesting.

- I'm working on several things at a time. Currently:
    - fixing up my website @ sch3fr.github.io
    - top secret mobile app project using Dart and Flutters
    - Custom 3D parts for a SFFPC
    - E-ink dashboard
- I'm in the middle of a summer break and I'm procrsatinating on my thesis by practicing coding whoops
- Feel free to reach out to me if you feel like I might be helpful in any kind of way ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘Œ
