### 'ello ðŸ«¡
I'm sch3fr. CS student, test engineer, overall computer nerd. I just like to mess around with anything that have chips and some kind of software.

- I'm working on several things at a time. Currently:
    - fixing up my website @ sch3fr.github.io
    - designing 3D printed mechanical keyboard
    - tweaking my old projects
- I am in the middle of Google certified cybersecurity course right now
- Feel free to reach me if you feel like I might be helpful in any kind of way ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘Œ
