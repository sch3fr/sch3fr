### 'ello ðŸ«¡
I'm sch3fr. CS student, test engineer, overall computer nerd. I just like to mess around with anything that have chips and some kind of software.

This place is mostly to hold my incoherent projects at one place, but I hope you find some of it interesting.

- I'm working on several things at a time. Currently:
    - fixing up my website @ sch3fr.github.io
    - designing new LED mask
    - tweaking my old projects
- I just finished summer semester, so I have a lot of time on my hands; hoping to use it well
- Feel free to reach out to me if you feel like I might be helpful in any kind of way ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘Œ
